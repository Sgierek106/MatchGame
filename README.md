# About Me
I've been a professional .NET developer since 2006.  I started off developing WinForms and ASP.NET Web Forms applications in C# in .NET Framework 2.0.  As I gained more experience, I also dabbled in Windows Services, and later became proficient with WPF by converting some rather complicated legacy VB6 applications at my workplace.

I tried several times to learn MVC, but could never quite get the hang of it.  Then, in 2016, I developed my first Web API and for some reason that project caused the MVC concepts to finally click.  My next MVC-ish project was a Razor Pages app in .NET Core 3.1, and that has officially become my new favorite project type to work with.

Regardless of how much I think I know about programming, there is always something more to learn; sometimes it just takes a different approach or a different perspective in order for the concepts to stick.  After reading the first four chapters of [Head First C# (4th edition)](https://github.com/head-first-csharp/fourth-edition), I find that I am definitely a big fan of the presentation style, and it's very effective at teaching an old dog like me a few new tricks.
